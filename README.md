🚀 Excited to share my latest project – a Weather Application Web App!
It features:
✔️ Real-time weather updates via API integration
✔️ Dynamic UI with changing backgrounds (Sunny, Rainy, Night, etc.)
✔️ Local city time, temperature, humidity, wind speed & more

This project helped me strengthen my skills in JavaScript, API handling, and responsive web design. Looking forward to applying these skills to more impactful projects 🌍✨
